# Project OverView

This Project focuses on the analysis conducted in the Movie Industry sector. Therefore, enabling Microsoft to make informed data driven decisions to venture in this new line of Business.

# Problem Statement
Microsoft Management is trying to get into the Movie Industry sector. It has seen several companies grossing billions of dollars in this sector therefore Microsoft has assigned me as the Lead DS to find actionable insights that will enable them to join in the fast paced Movie Industry.

    1. Define the problem.
    2. Collect the data. Datasets: IMDB,The Numbers & Box Office Mojo.
    3. Data Cleaning.
    4. Analyze the data.

The most popular movies go hand in hand with the most vote counts.


# Conclusion
Based on the findings, the conclusions that were found are as follows:

    1. The High the Domestic Gross, the high the Worldwide gross return for most of the movies. 
    2. The movies that grossed highly per annum were released around the Mid-year.
    3. Most movies with higher Vote count were Popular.
    4. BV Studios release movies that are profitable to the movie market.
    

# Recommendation
Microsoft should have their own TV Network so as to encorage Content Creators to associate with their brand and also roll out the subscription model in Contrast with the competitors in the market. The TV Network approach is what will boost their entry into the Movie Industry thus a profit generating one.

# Future Work
Given additional time I would pursue the following:

    1. Explore the relationship between the movie gross against it's rating and comments i.e domestically and worldwide.
    2. Find institutions which can we can partner with for Movie and Art School to encarage Young and Aspiring Filmakers.
