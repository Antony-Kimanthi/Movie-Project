# Problem Statement
Microsoft Management is trying to get into the Movie Industry sector. It has seen several companies grossing billions of dollars in this sector therefore Microsoft has assigned me as the Lead DS to find actionable insights that will enable them to join in the fast paced Movie Industry.

# Business Understanding
In this analysis, we are going to look at the following:
    1. The movie trends that are currently preffered?
    2. Market share of the movies produced per company?
    3.

# Conclusion
Based on these findings the conclusions to Microsoft are as follows:
    1. Microsoft should embrace more child related programs thus building trust to the consumers.
    2. Produce more movie genres that have high ratings overall based on the past releases.
    3. Target to produce atleast 7- 10 movies on a yearly basis.

# Recommendation
Microsoft should have their own TV Network so as to encorage Content Creators to associate with their brand and also roll out the subscription model in Contrast with the competitors in the market. The TV Network approach is what will boost their entry into the Movie Industry thus a profit generating one.

# Future Work
Given addional time I would pursue the following:
    1. Explore the relationship between the movie gross against it's rating and comment i.e domestically and worldwide.
    2. Find institutions which can we can partner with for Movie and Art School to encarage Young and Aspiring Filmakers.
